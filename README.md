# Gods Eye — Ghost Edition

**A live 3D intelligence globe in the browser.**  
Track aircraft and ships, inspect contacts, and fly the planet — without a Google Maps bill, without OpenAI, and without signing up for an API key.

Rebuild of the open-source [God's Eye View](https://github.com/bilawalsidhu/gods-eye-view) client: smoother contact handling, a rebuilt ship/plane inspect flow, and a default path that stays **keyless**. Full credit to the original developer for creating an amazing and beautiful tool. I simply wanted to make it easier for people and make some changes to improve the UI.

## Why Ghost Edition

Most “live map” stacks quietly depend on a paid Google Maps Platform key for the planet, then another metered key if you want an AI mic. Ghost Edition is built so the **default experience costs nothing to run**.

| You do not need | What you get instead |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Google Maps billing** | Satellite and OSM globe stacks out of the box. Photorealistic Google 3D stays optional — never required. |
| **An OpenAI key** | The console, layers, HUD, and inspect panel all work without voice. The mic is extra, not the product. |
| **Paid map / AIS / ADS-B APIs** | `npm install` and `npm run dev`. Live flights and ships come from public feeds. No account, no credit card. |

**Benefits you feel immediately**

- **Zero-cost start.** Clone, install, open the globe. No Cloud Console, no usage alerts, no “Map Tiles API not enabled.”
- **Smoother contacts.** Clicking a ship or plane inspects it in place. The camera no longer yanks you off the scene.
- **Rebuilt inspect.** Aircraft can still show a live airframe photo when one exists. Vessels use a clear static graphic plus **origin country** from the AIS flag state (MMSI MID + ISO code) so you can log fleets by country.
- **Honest globe.** Public transponders, public cameras, public orbital elements — labeled when something is delayed, simulated, or missing.

---

## Quick start

**Requires Node.js 18+.** No `.env` file is required.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 4173
```

Open **http://localhost:4173**.

That is the whole entry fee. Optional keys (Google 3D, OpenAI voice, AISStream, FIRMS, TomTom, Cesium ion) live in `.env.example` if you ever want extras. Leave them blank and Ghost Edition keeps running.

## Ships & planes

Ghost Edition rebuilds how you **look at** live traffic — not just how it is drawn.

**Click does not steal the camera.** Select a contact and the inspect dossier opens at the top of the screen. You stay on the view you chose.

**Aircraft**

- Live ADS-B from public networks (anonymous OpenSky + adsb.lol).
- Trail, heading, and kinematics stay on the globe.
- Inspect panel: identity, route when the public lookup has one, photo when Planespotters has one.

**Vessels**

- Live AIS without an AISStream key (Open Waters snapshot). Optional AISStream key only if you want a denser private stream.
- Military / type-35 contacts render in **bright red**.
- Inspect panel: name, class, speed, course, and **origin country** (flag state from MMSI), plus ISO country code and MID for logging.
- Static vessel graphic instead of broken Wikipedia photos.

Motion is interpolated between sparse live fixes, and icons keep **true-world heading** as you orbit — no spinning glyphs.

## What's live

Turn layers on from the tray. Most of them need **no key**.

| Layer | What you see | Needs a key? |
|-------|----------------|--------------|
| **Satellite / OSM globe** | Worldwide basemap + terrain | No |
| **Live flights** | Civilian ADS-B traffic | No |
| **Military flights** | Military ADS-B (adsb.lol) | No |
| **Live vessels** | AIS ships, origin country on inspect | No |
| **Satellites** | Catalog + ISS-class tracks (CelesTrak) | No |
| **Earthquakes** | USGS, last 24h | No |
| **CCTV** | Public city cameras in the 3D scene | No |
| **Radio / bikeshare / launches** | Geolocated public feeds | No |
| **Traffic** | Simulated flow keyless; TomTom optional for live jams | No |
| **Fires** | NASA FIRMS | Optional free map key |
| **Google Photorealistic 3D** | Street-level mesh | Optional, **billed by Google** |
| **Voice / AI HUD** | OpenAI Realtime | Optional, **billed by OpenAI** |

**Keyboard:** `1`–`7` visual styles · `H` HUD · `D` detection · `C` cockpit · `` ` `` Tommy console · `Esc` close inspect.

## How it stays free

Ghost Edition does not proxy your wallet through Google or OpenAI unless **you** add those keys.

- **Globe:** Esri satellite and OpenStreetMap by default. Cesium ion is optional for Bing stacks.
- **Air:** OpenSky anonymous mode + adsb.lol. No ADS-B vendor contract.
- **Sea:** Keyless AIS snapshot. Flag state is decoded from the MMSI — useful for country logs, not a shipyard “built in” field (AIS does not carry that).
- **Voice:** Off until `OPENAI_API_KEY` exists. The rest of the product does not wait on it.

If you later enable Google Map Tiles or OpenAI, those providers bill you — Ghost Edition never requires them.

## Tommy harness — drive the map with your own model

The voice controller is OpenAI's. The **harness** is the typed path to the exact
same 28 map verbs, driven by a private or self-hosted model. Both end up in one
place — `runner`, the model-agnostic dispatcher in `src/voice/gevActions.js` —
so nothing about the map is reimplemented, and the voice path is untouched.

```
OpenAI Realtime (voice)        your model (typed)
        │                              │
        └──────────► runner ◄──────────┘
                       │
                   the map
```

**Run it against LM Studio** (Bionic or classic — both serve the same
OpenAI-compatible API at `localhost:1234`):

1. Load a tool-calling model in LM Studio and start its local server.
2. `npm run dev` — no configuration needed; `http://localhost:1234/v1` is the
   default target.
3. Click **TOMMY** above the command dock, or press `` ` ``, and type:
   *"fly to Tokyo and show me aircraft"*.

The console prints the reply plus an `actions:` line naming every verb that
ran — and every one that failed, individually, so a confident sentence from the
model can't paper over an action that didn't happen.

Any OpenAI-shaped `/v1` endpoint with tool calling works (vLLM, Ollama,
llama.cpp, LM proxies): point `HARNESS_LLM_BASE_URL` at it. Swapping to a
protocol that *isn't* OpenAI-shaped means writing one adapter in
`src/harness/backends/` — nothing in `gevActions.js` or the map changes.

**No secrets in the browser.** The endpoint, the key, and the model id live
server-side behind `/api/harness/chat`, the same pattern as
`/api/realtime/token`. See `.env.example` for the knobs, including how to turn
the harness off.

Each turn the model is handed a live state snapshot built from the same read
verbs the voice model calls (`get_current_view_state` + `analyst_query`),
including their warm-up and provenance notes — so a layer that was enabled two
seconds ago gets narrated as *still loading* rather than as a low count.

```
src/harness/
├── harnessController.js    # text-in / actions-out turn loop
├── snapshot.js             # live world state, honesty notes intact
├── harnessConsole.js       # the typed console in the HUD
└── backends/               # swap the model here, and only here
```

## Run notes

- The dev server binds to **localhost** by default so nothing on your LAN can spend optional keys you might add later.
- Cold start is typically a couple of seconds on a recent laptop.
- Live data can be delayed, incomplete, or wrong. This is an exploration console, not a navigation or emergency tool.
